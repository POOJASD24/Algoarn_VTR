# üß•Virtual Trial Room ‚Äî Python AI-Based 3D Shirt Fitting
## üß©Overview
This Python script enables a quick virtual try-on experience for an upper-body shirt using a combination of computer vision, AI-based depth estimation, and 3D mesh processing.
It performs a realistic shirt fitting by:
‚Ä¢	Capturing a live webcam frame of the user.
‚Ä¢	Estimating depth maps for both the person and the shirt using MiDaS.
‚Ä¢	Building 3D meshes from the depth data and alpha masks.
‚Ä¢	Detecting body keypoints using MediaPipe Pose Estimation.
‚Ä¢	Projecting and wrapping the shirt mesh onto the person‚Äôs body using KDTree-based surface mapping, along with scaling, rotation, and neck-hole adjustment.
‚Ä¢	Exporting combined OBJ/MTL files and textures to the output/ directory.

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `os`                   | File and directory management (creating `output/`, handling paths).                     |
| `cv2 (OpenCV)`         | Webcam capture, image I/O, resizing, thresholding, and texture saving.                  |

| `ctypes`               | Reads screen size to scale preview window (**Windows-specific**).                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è High-Level Pipeline (Step-by-Step)
#### 1.	Start / Setup
‚Ä¢	Create the output/ folder.
‚Ä¢	Load MiDaS small model and transformations via torch.hub.
‚Ä¢	Initialize MediaPipe Pose and Selfie Segmentation modules.

#### 2.	Capture
‚Ä¢	Open a resizable webcam preview window.
‚Ä¢	Press SPACE to capture the frame.

#### 3.	Foreground Mask & Person Texture
‚Ä¢	Generate an alpha mask using Selfie Segmentation.
‚Ä¢	Combine RGB and alpha channels to form an RGBA texture for the person.

#### 5.	Depth Estimation (MiDaS)
‚Ä¢	Run MiDaS on both the person frame and the shirt image to produce depth_person and depth_shirt.

#### 6.	Mesh Creation from Depth + Alpha
‚Ä¢	create_mesh_from_depth() builds:
‚Ä¢	Vertices (x, y, z) where z is scaled depth.
‚Ä¢	UV coordinates based on image-space projection.
‚Ä¢	Triangle faces for all valid alpha pixels.
‚Ä¢	Exports a simple, textured OBJ using save_obj().

#### 7.	Pose Keypoints Extraction
‚Ä¢	extract_pose_keypoints() returns 2D pixel coordinates for major landmarks (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, nose, neck).

#### 8.	Shirt Projection / Wrapping
‚Ä¢	project_shirt_to_upper_keypoints() performs the main wrapping process:
‚Ä¢	Matches 3D person vertices to 2D pose keypoints.
‚Ä¢	Scales the shirt mesh to match shoulder width.
‚Ä¢	Rotates the shirt for correct shoulder alignment.
‚Ä¢	Uses KDTree to ‚Äúsnap‚Äù shirt vertices to the nearest body surface points.
‚Ä¢	Extends sleeves toward elbows.
‚Ä¢	Cuts a neck opening based on proximity to neck center.
‚Ä¢	Smooths and recalculates UVs.

#### 9.	Combine & Export
‚Ä¢	Merges person and shirt meshes.
‚Ä¢	Saves final combined .obj and .mtl models with separate materials and textures inside output/.

## üíæ Files Created
‚Ä¢	output/person_mesh.obj + .mtl + person_texture.png
‚Ä¢	output/shirt_mesh.obj + .mtl + shirt_texture.png
‚Ä¢	output/person_with_upperbody_shirt.obj + .mtl ‚Äî final fitted model

## ‚ö†Ô∏èLimitations & Issues
#### üîπ Depth / Geometry
‚Ä¢	MiDaS produces relative depth, not metric ‚Äî scaling can vary.
‚Ä¢	No camera intrinsics, so 3D positions are approximate.
‚Ä¢	Meshes may be dense or noisy, not ideal for physics or animation.
‚Ä¢	Normals not exported ‚Äî shading may look inconsistent.

#### üîπ Wrapping / Alignment
‚Ä¢	KDTree snapping is na√Øve ‚Äî can clip through body.
‚Ä¢	No physics (gravity, drape, collisions).
‚Ä¢	Neck-hole carving is 2D heuristic, may over/under-cut.
‚Ä¢	Sleeve alignment is rough, not topology-aware.
‚Ä¢	Rotation limited to Y-axis only ‚Äî torso tilt may misalign.

#### üîπ Pose & Landmarks
‚Ä¢	Uses static MediaPipe mode ‚Äî no temporal smoothing.
‚Ä¢	Neck point is an estimated average, may vary across poses.

#### üîπ Texturing / UV Mapping
‚Ä¢	Bounding-box UV projection ‚Äî may stretch shirt textures.
‚Ä¢	Minimal material separation and surface color settings.

#### üîπ Reliability / Compatibility
‚Ä¢	Windows-specific (uses ctypes.windll.user32).
‚Ä¢	Needs internet on first run to download MiDaS model.
‚Ä¢	High memory usage for large meshes.
‚Ä¢	Unity/Three.js may require rotation/scaling fix.

## üöÄ Potential Improvements
‚Ä¢	Integrate camera intrinsics for real 3D coordinate reprojection.
‚Ä¢	Use normal-aware projection for better surface conformity.
‚Ä¢	Replace KDTree with closest-point-on-triangle mapping.
‚Ä¢	Add cloth simulation (mass-spring or physics-based).
‚Ä¢	Detect neck hole in 3D instead of 2D projection.
‚Ä¢	Perform retopology for clean, manifold meshes.
‚Ä¢	Preserve original shirt UVs via UV-transfer.
‚Ä¢	Extend to MediaPipe Holistic for full-body keypoints.
‚Ä¢	Add temporal smoothing for real-time webcam mode.

## üì¶ Runtime Notes & Requirements
‚Ä¢	Requires E:\VTR PROJECT\output\blackshirt.jpg (shirt image).
‚Ä¢	First run downloads MiDaS model via torch.hub.
‚Ä¢	Outputs saved to output/ directory.

## üß™ Common Runtime Issues
| **Issue**                       | **Description**                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Shirt floating or clipping      | Incorrect depth scaling or alignment.        |
| Neck hole too large / misplaced | Neck heuristic mismatch.                     |
| Sleeves look distorted          | Elbow projection not aligned.                |
| OBJ imports incorrectly         | Axis mismatch or missing normals.            |
| Slow performance                | High-res frames or CPU-only MiDaS inference. |
